# online-quiz-application-in-JSP

This repository contains a web application called 'online quiz' in which registered admin can enter quiz with all the details and users can take those quizes with result evaluation. 
This application incorporates a combination of front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, and JS) to design the user interface and interactive elements, while the back-end is powered by JSP (JavaServer Pages) and MySQL to manage data storage, retrieval, and processing.
